TODO:

Remove `print` calls in `main.py` or replace with logging calls.

Make `lib/util.py` a less generic name or roll up into some other class.

Is there a standard Angular way to not make a request if the last such request hasn't completed yet?
See use of `fetching` in `getAccessPoints` in https://github.com/george-hawkins/wifi-setup-material/blob/master/src/app/access-points/access-points.component.ts
