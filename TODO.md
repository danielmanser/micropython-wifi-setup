TODO:

Move things into `lib` with `slim`, `micro_srv_2`, `logging`, `shim.py` and `schedule` at top level.

Is there a standard Angular way to not make a request if the last such request hasn't completed yet?
See use of `fetching` in `getAccessPoints` in https://github.com/george-hawkins/wifi-setup-material/blob/master/src/app/access-points/access-points.component.ts

Remove `print` calls in `main.py` or replace with logging calls.
